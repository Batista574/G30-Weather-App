The Local Weather & Holiday Dashboard is designed as a web application dashboard that provides users with day-to-day information in one convenient place. It integrates data from three different sources: live weather data retrieved through an API, Namibian public holidays stored in a JSON file, and a custom “countdown to weekend” widget. It also displays the local time, ensuring users always have accurate and up-to-date information.
